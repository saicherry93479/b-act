            <h2>Patent Registration at a Glance</h2>
            <p>A Patent is an exclusive set of rights granted by the Authority to the Applicant of an invention for a period of 20 years under the Patent Act in India.</p>
            <p>A Patent is a legal document, which gives an inventor the exclusive right to make, use, and sell an invention for a specified number of years.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>What is Patentable?</h2>
            <p>To qualify for a patent, the invention must meet three basic tests:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Novelty:</strong> The invention must be novel, meaning that the invention did not previously exist.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-obviousness:</strong> The invention must be non-obvious, which means that it must be a significant improvement to existing technology. Simple changes to previously known devices do not comprise a patentable invention.</li>
                <li><strong>Utility:</strong> The proposed invention must be useful. Legal experts commonly interpret this to mean that no patent will be granted for inventions that can only be used for an illegal or immoral purpose.</li>

                <div class="faq-answer">Drafting a patent application is a specialised job and requires both technical (field of invention) and legal (Indian patent act) understanding.
                    As you know, patent is a techno-legal document. Many inventors trying to write patent application on their own writes it from completely technical perspective. Writing patent application as a technical document without considering legal aspect may be a mistake which can make your application not worth a lot. And all the efforts you took for research and development can go waste.
                    Hence, right patent professional (or patent agent) with appropriate experience can remarkably add value to patent application.

                <div class="faq-answer">No. Patent protection is a territorial right and therefore it is effective only within the territory of India. There is no concept of global patent.
                    However, filing an application in India enables the applicant to file a corresponding application for same invention in convention countries or under PCT, within or before expiry of twelve months from the filing date in India. Patents should be obtained in each
                    country where the applicant requires protection of his invention.</div>

                    An application for a patent can be filed at the earliest possible date and should not be delayed. An application filed with provisional specification, disclosing the essence of the nature of the invention helps to register the priority of the invention. Delay in filing an application may entail some risks such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>(i) Some other inventor might file a patent application on the said invention.</li>

                    Generally, an invention which has been either published or publicly displayed cannot be patented as such publication or public display leads to lack of novelty. However, under certain circumstances, the Patents Act provides a grace period of 12 months for filing of patent application from the date of its publication in a journal or its public display in an exhibition organised by the Government or disclosure before any learned society or published by the applicant. The detailed conditions are provided under Chapter VI of the Act (Section 29-34).

                    It is not necessary to visit the patent office to file the application as online filing facility is provided. Only in case the application is required to be filed offline, the same can be filed physically at the counter of the Office. Moreover, all the communications with the office are made through emails. However, hearing proceedings relating to patent application can be attended with prior appointment on any working day during the prosecution stage.
