            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">What is meant by ‘Design’ under the Designs Act, 2000?
                    <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">‘Design’ means only the features of shape, configuration, pattern, or ornament or composition of lines or colour, or combination thereof applied to any article, whether two-dimensional or three-dimensional, by any industrial process or means, which in the finished article appeal to and are judged solely by the eye. It does not include any mode or principle of construction or anything which is merely a mechanical device, nor does it include any trademark or artistic works as defined under the Copyright Act, 1957.</div>

                <div class="faq-question">Can stamps, labels, tokens, or cards be considered an article for the purpose of registration of Design?

                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">No. Because once the alleged design (i.e., ornamentation) is removed, only a piece of paper, metal, or similar material remains, and the article referred ceases to exist. The article must have its existence independent of the designs applied to it. [Design with respect to label was held not registrable by an Order on civil original case No. 9-D of 1963, Punjab, High Court]. So, the design as applied to an article should be integral with the article itself.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">The duration of the registration of a design is initially ten years from the date of registration. This period can be extended for an additional five years on an application made in Form-3, accompanied by the prescribed fees, to the Controller before the expiry of the initial period.

                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">The registration of a design confers upon the registered proprietor copyright in the design for the period of registration. This copyright means the exclusive right to apply the design to the article belonging to the class in which it is registered.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">To ascertain whether registration subsists in respect of a design, a request should be made to the Patent Office. If the design number is known, the request should be made on Form 6; otherwise, on Form 7, along with the prescribed fees. Each request should be confined to information regarding a single design.</div>

                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Piracy of a design means the application of a design or its imitation to any article belonging to the class of articles in which the design has been registered for the purpose of sale or importation of such articles without the written consent of the registered proprietor. Publishing such articles or exposing them for sale with knowledge of the unauthorized application of the design also involves piracy of the design.</div>

                <div class="faq-answer">If anyone contravenes the copyright in a design, they are liable for every offence to pay a sum not exceeding Rs. 25,000 to the registered proprietor, subject to a maximum of Rs. 50,000 recoverable as contract debt in respect of any one design. The registered proprietor may bring a suit for the recovery of damages for any such contravention and for an injunction against repetition of the same. The total sum recoverable shall not exceed Rs. 50,000 as contract debt, as stated in Section 22(2)(a). The suit for infringement, recovery of damages, etc., should not be filed in any court below the court of District Judge.</div>
