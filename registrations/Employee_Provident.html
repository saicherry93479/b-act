                <div class="faq-answer">A provident fund is created to provide financial stability and security to the working class. An employee begins contributing to this fund on a monthly basis when he/she starts out as an employee. The purpose of an EPF is to help employees save a part of their salary every month to be used when the employee is no longer fit to carry on working, i.e., when the employee has to retire from service, or is terminated, or is retrenched for any valid reasons.</div>

                <div class="faq-question">What does contribution mean in the context of EPF? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Contribution means a contribution payable in respect of a member under a scheme or the contribution payable in respect of an employee to whom the insurance scheme applies. Therefore, both the employer and employee contribute to the Employees Provident Fund at a rate of 12% of the basic salary and dearness allowance (if any) every month. This fund is maintained and overseen by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation of India (EPFO). Any company with over 20 employees is required by law to register with the EPFO, which is the authority made under the said Act to check the correct implementation of the Act.</div>
