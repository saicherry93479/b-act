            <h2>Company Dissolutions and Strike Off </h2>
            <p>Closing down a company is require a routine procedure. Without doing so, you would need to annually meet the requirements of the Registrar of Companies (which means spending money on audit and compliances). The bigger reason you would want to do this, of course, is because it releases the assets and investments made by you. The procedure for winding up of a company can be initiated voluntarily by the shareholders or forced by a tribunal or a court.            </h2>
