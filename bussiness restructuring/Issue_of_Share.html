            <p>Companies issue shares as a means of raising additional capital to fund business operations or take up new investments. Public companies need approval from their shareholders before issuing shares.

            <p> By issuing debentures means issue of a certificate by the company under its seal which is an acknowledgment of debt taken by the company. The procedure of issue of debentures by a company is similar to that of the issue of shares. A Prospectus is issued, applications are invited, and letters of allotment are issued.

                Debenture is most important instrument and method of raising the loan capital by the company. A debenture is like a certificate of loan or a loan bond evidencing the fact that the company is liable to pay a specified amount with interest and although the money raised by the debentures becomes a part of the company's capital structure, it does not become share capital.
